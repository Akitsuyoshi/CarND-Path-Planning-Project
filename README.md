## Overview

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

- Build a path planner using  its location, its sensor fusion data, and highway map data
- Safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic
- Summarize the results

This repo includes the following files.

| File     | Description |
|:--------:|:-----------:|
| [main.cpp](./src/main.cpp) | the script to compile this project|
| [spline.h](./src/spline.h)| the script to designe to extrapolate linearly|
| [cost.h](./src/cost.h)| the script to calculate cost for each tragectory|
|README.md| this file, a summary of the project|

The original [spline](./src/spline.h) library can be found at [this link](https://github.com/ttk592/spline/).

## Dependencies

This project requires:

- [Udacity self-driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2)

## Build steps

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: mkdir build && cd build
3. Compile: cmake .. && make
4. Run it: ./path_planning.

## Path planner pipeline

### 1. Set initial lane and velocity

I only considered 3 lanes in this project, first lane is 0, second is 1, and third one is 2.

The initial lane is second lane on the right side, so I set it to 1. The initial velocity is 0.

```c++
// main.cpp

int lane = 1;
double ref_vel = 0.;
```

### 2. Update the car's (s, d)Frenet Coordinates.

If car has previous path data, I set last seen (s, d) data as current one for the smooth transition. It can work especially when higher latency is involved.

### 3. See which lane the car can change

The car can change laned based on its current lane. For example, if car is currently on first lane(0), it can change second lane(1) or don't change(0).

```c++
//main.cpp

vector<int> available_lanes;
// The case of keeping forward
available_lanes.push_back(lane);
// Considers 3 cases.
if (lane == 0) {
  available_lanes.push_back(1);
} else if (lane == 1) {
  available_lanes.push_back(0);
  available_lanes.push_back(2);
} else if (lane == 2) {
  available_lanes.push_back(1);
}
```

### 4 Detect if car ahead is too close

First of all, I assumed that getting trajectory in this project is the finite state machine. I considered 3 lane in this highway simulator.

The car uses sensor fusion data to detect if car ahead is too close or not. The car considers only if tracked car is ahead of it. The distance between the tracked car and the car should be more than `30m` that buffer are set as `BUFFER_BETWEEN_CAR` in [cost.h](./src/cost.h).

```c++
// cost.h

const int BUFFER_BETWEEN_CAR = 30;
```

### 5. Consider lane Change

The considers lane changes only when car ahead is too close. If tracked car is too close, the decrease its velocity, `- 0.224`.

The car behaves defferently given a state and prediction. The car predict the best tragectory calculating its cost like how the car is unlikey to collide with other traffic etc.

I decided to use 2 cost functions in [cost.h](./src/cost.h). Those 2 functions considered in the same time, and car use its cost to decide if it change lane or keep forward. Those 2 functions, `collision_cost` and `buffer_cost` are following.

```c++
// cost.h

float collision_cost(double car_s, double check_car_s) {
  if (abs(check_car_s - car_s) < BUFFER_BETWEEN_CAR) {
    return 1.;
  }
  return 0.;
}

float buffer_cost(double car_s, double check_car_s) {
  return logistic(BUFFER_BETWEEN_CAR / abs(check_car_s - car_s));
}
```

On top of that, I set weights for each cost functions. Both of the 2 case, collision and buffer, can be called as safety problem but I prioritise collision more that taking buffer.

```c++
// cost.h

const float COLLISION = pow(10, 6);
const float BUFFER = pow(10, 4);
```

The car considerd all possible cases calculating its corresponding cost functions, and then decide its lane change.

The best lane is the most minimun cost lane.

### 6. Increase / Decrease velocity

The car increase its velocity if it is less than `49.5` to keep it maximumã€€speed as much as possible. If other traffic is ahead of the car and it is too close, car keep decreasing it velocity unless the car change lane.

### 7. Expolarate points for smooth transition

I mostly take advandate of spline library to expolarate points for smooth transition. The most of code can be seen from the Udacity lesson.

The path planner should output a list of x and y global map coordinates. I use 50 points to each x and y way points. The 50 way points contains a few previous path and the rest is new generated one. The reason for that is to make car move smoothly regardles of timing defference.
